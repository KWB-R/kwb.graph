How to build kwb.graph

- delete kwb.graph and kwb.graph.Rcheck in the build directory 
  (<build-dir>, e.g. "C:\Users\hsonne\Desktop\tmp\_RBuild")
- open the R script ..\..\RScripts\hsInlineDoc.r
- source the script
- run the line 'rebuildPackage("kwb.graph")'
- create a folder <build-dir>\kwb.graph\libs and move 
  <build-dir>\kwb.graph\src\kwb.graph.dll into that folder
- run the batch script <build-dir>\hs_kwb.graph_0PdfAndBuild.bat (again).
